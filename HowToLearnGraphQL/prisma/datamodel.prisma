# Because Prisma uses GraphQL SDL for model definitions, you can basically copy the existing Link definition from schema.graphql into datamodel.prisma.

# here are two main differences compared to the previous Link version from schema.graphql.
# First, you’re adding the @id directive to the id: ID! field. This means Prisma will auto-generate and store globally unique IDs for the Link records in the database on the id field.
# Second, you’re adding a new field called createdAt: DateTime! @createdAt. Thanks to the @createdAt directive, this field is also managed by Prisma and will be read-only in the API. It stores the time for when a specific Link was created. You can also annotate a field with the @updatedAt directive to track when a record was last updated.

type Link {
  id: ID! @id
  createdAt: DateTime! @createdAt
  description: String!
  url: String!
  postedBy: User
}

# 新增 postedBy 欄位指向 User

# Adding a User model in database
type User {
  id: ID! @id
  name: String!
  email: String! @unique
  password: String!
  links: [Link!]!
}
